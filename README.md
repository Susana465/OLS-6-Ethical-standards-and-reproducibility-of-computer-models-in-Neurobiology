# OLS 6 project: Ethical standards and reproducibility of computer models in Neurobiology

Hello! Welcome, please have a read at what it is that I am doing here:

## What is this project?

This is a project I am working on during my time at Open Life Sciences and Turing Enrichment placement.
My aim here is to create a practical guide/case study that others can use, using my PhD journey as an example, to creating more reproducible and ethical research.

I work with scientists from varied research backgrounds to discuss ethics and reproducibility in creating computer models in Neurobiology. This is so that the broad science community can become aware of potential biases they continue to carry unless questioned and critiqued, so that we can move towards a more inclusive and accessible, and away from the imperialist white supremacist patriarchal culture we live in.

*You can find more in depth details for this project [here](https://github.com/Susana465/OLS-6-Ethical-standards-and-reproducibility-of-computer-models-in-Neurobiology/issues/1)*

## Why do I do this?
 - To tackle reproducibility issues and stop wasting money, time and resources in general.
 - To bring awareness reproducibility only makes sense if bias is accounted for too. Otherwise, oppressive biases carry on without being questioned.

## How long will this take?
Hmmm, not a single answer question. My time with Open Life Sciences and the Turing Institute is schedule to last until next spring and summer (2023). However this is a long time coming project. It's a blossom of all of the years I have spent in academia wondering if a project like this would ever be possible.

Roadmap for this project is about to be drafted!
